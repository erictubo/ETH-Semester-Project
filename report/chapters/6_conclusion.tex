% Quality of results, accuracy, ...

...

Algorithm requires a variety of track shapes to yield accurate results. ...
Obvious since the residual is in 2D but the pose estimate is 3D 6DoF


% Robustness, ...
When it comes to robustness (to different track shapes) ...


% Extensions, future work, ...
% implement track detection
Possible extensions to this project include the implementation of a track detection algorithm, which would allow the pipeline to be used on any railway ...
