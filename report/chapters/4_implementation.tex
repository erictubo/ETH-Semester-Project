\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}

This chapter dives into the implementation details of the method described in the previous chapter


Objects, classes \& interactions

Algorithmic implementation, efficiency, speed

Flowchart of code (files, classes, methods)


Better as table ???



Using Python for most tasks

C++ for optimization with Ceres

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Ceres, ...

\section{Python Classes \& Objects (Methods, Data)}


... main file \& sequence


\subsection{Railway}

Which mehods \& data types enable the process as described in method


For efficiency: build using combined map of relevant keyframes


\subsection{Keyframe \& GPS}


Image, annotations


\subsection{Camera}





\subsection{Transformation}






\section{C++ Optimization: Ceres Solver}

\subsection{Cost Function}

\subsection{Residuals}

\subsection{Parameters}



\section{Required Input Data}

Data file + any files imported and exported

Add to ReadMe: where to specify file paths / how to get data


railway map data ... from OSM file ?

elevation data ... from file ?



images \& poses ... export from ROS Bags



annotations as CSV ... using Website ? to create annotations

saving Railway object to file


\section{Output Data}

File paths to specify to save visualisations etc.
